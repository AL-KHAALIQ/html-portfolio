<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a B.Tech Mechanical engineer turned into software developer through self study and hardwork. Switching from the field of Mechanical Engineering to coding and Software/Web development was never easy. I struggled a lot during the initial stages on understanding the concepts, however I had a knack to code as I was a computer geek and had some idea of coding through C and C++ taugh in school level .</p>

<p> I've never stopped learning to this moment and I'm continuing to gain knowledge as any kind of information is knowledge and has better use in the right hands.
    I'm really happy that I switched my profession to software as I'm able to enjoy being more productive and efficient. I've a feeling that I've found my purpose or the right job for me as nothing gives me the kick of the code that I've put my soul into actually works and gives the right output which it was supposed to give.
    So, that's all about me and my journey into the digital world. I aim to continously improve with my present skills at hand and also trying to develop more productive and efficient skills from my mentors, seniors and colleagues.
